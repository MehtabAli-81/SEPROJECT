Description:
         This project assignment is a collaborative effort by a team of four group members to design and develop an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system using Java programming language, Apache Ant build system, and Git version control. The project aims to demonstrate our understanding of software development principles, teamwork, and version control. The ATM system allows users to perform basic banking transactions, including balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, and deposit. The system is designed to ensure secure and efficient transactions.
Technical Details:
- Programming Language: Java
- Build System: Apache Ant
- Version Control: Git

Collaboration.
          This project was developed collaboratively by the four group members, with each member contributing to different aspects of the project. We used Git to manage our codebase, track changes, and collaborate on the projec
Conclusion:
         We hope that this project demonstrates our understanding of software development principles, teamwork, and version control. We are proud to submit this project assignment to Dr. Gul Sher Laghari and look forward to feedback and suggestions for improvement.
